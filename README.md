In this Project, we will talk about detection method of Blood Cancer. Blood cancer is cancer that develops from Blood cells. If it is not identified in the early-stage then the result will be the death of the patient. Worldwide near about 12% of people affected by Blood cancer and the number is still increasing.
So to tackle this problem , ML plays a very important role. ML algorithms helps to determine cells whether Malignant or Benign .ML algorithms can determine cancer cells more efficiently.
